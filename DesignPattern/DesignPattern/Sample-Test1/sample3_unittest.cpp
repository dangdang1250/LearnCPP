// A sample program demonstrating using Google C++ testing framework.

// In this example, we use a more advanced feature of Google Test called
// test fixture.
//
// A test fixture is a place to hold objects and functions shared by
// all tests in a test case.  Using a test fixture avoids duplicating
// the test code necessary to initialize and cleanup those common
// objects for each test.  It is also useful for defining sub-routines
// that your tests need to invoke a lot.
//
// <TechnicalDetails>
//
// The tests share the test fixture in the sense of code sharing, not
// data sharing.  Each test is given its own fresh copy of the
// fixture.  You cannot expect the data modified by one test to be
// passed on to another test, which is a bad idea.
//
// The reason for this design is that tests should be independent and
// repeatable.  In particular, a test should not fail as the result of
// another test's failure.  If one test depends on info produced by
// another test, then the two tests should really be one big test.
//
// The macros for indicating the success/failure of a test
// (EXPECT_TRUE, FAIL, etc) need to know what the current test is
// (when Google Test prints the test result, it tells you which test
// each failure belongs to).  Technically, these macros invoke a
// member function of the Test class.  Therefore, you cannot use them
// in a global function.  That's why you should put test sub-routines
// in a test fixture.
//
