### Algorithim 
    In general, the algorithm do not work directly on a container. Instead, they operate by traversing a range of elements bounded by two iterators.

    Tpyically, as the algorithm traverses the range, it does something with EACH element.

### Lambda
    A lambda expression represents callable unit of code.

### Adapter
    An adapter is a general concept in the library. There are container, iterator, and function adapters. Essentally, an adapter is a mechanism for making one thing act like another.

    A container adapter takes an existing container type and make it act like a different type.

    For example, the stack adaptor takes a sequential container and make it operate as if it were a stack!
