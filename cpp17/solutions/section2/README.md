##Implementing Algorithms in Terms of iterators
- Iterators usually iterate by moving their position from one item of container to another
- Don't necessarily need to iterator over data structures at all
- Iterators can also be used to implement algorithms, they would calculate next value when incremented and return that value when dereferenced
